                I am a very curious person and full of enthusiasm. I always try
                to improve myself and give the best of me in everything I do, I
                love working on a team and tend to boost the teams I'm part of
                with motivation and leadership.
            </p>

                Apart from Computer Science, I like chess, basketball and
                exercising. Although the thing that motivates me the most and
                always pushes me past my limits is fatherhood. I have a
                beautiful daughter for whom I strive to be the best father in
                the world.
